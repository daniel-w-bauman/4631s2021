StarvingArtist

Problem:
Many people have a hobby of making art of various types – drawing, sculpturing, poem writing, 3D printing – but most are not professional enough to turn their artistic expression profitable and must fund their hobby through personal funds and give away too many projects to friends with family as they run out of storage room. Many other people like art, and would love to decorate their house, but live paycheck to paycheck and cannot realistically afford to pay the high prices of professional art. 

Goal:
Provide a market for hobbyist artists to offer their art projects or their services as artists for people looking for cheaply available art.

Deliverables: 
Provide an app to connect hobbyist artists to interested buyers, but not facilitate the purchasing process, by the end of the semester.
