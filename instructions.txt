The main project is an android app that can be launched, built, and run
using android studio.

The project's directory needs to be opened using android studio, it is
the StarvinArtist directory. Then, click the triangle button in android studio.

The node server must be started first for full functionality, by running node server.js
Also, a mongodb database must be run on the machine, and the local ip address
needs to be stored in the file config.java under the ip variable.

Functionality:
Looping through photos, searching photos by tag, looking at photo's information
(contact info, price, name). Uploading photos, but not through app, rather through
HTTP POST client such as postman.
